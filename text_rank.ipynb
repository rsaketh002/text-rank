We have given him a proposal of four seats. Now it is upto them to accept it or not. There are 4-5 parties in the MVA, so all have to get their share. We have given a four seat proposal to the VBA. I think this is a good offer and these are the seats from among those that Ambedkar had asked for,” Raut said. “Even if the VBA is not with us, we will win, the MVA will win since we have the people with us. Had VBA been with us, our margins would have been higher. The people are with us, Prakash Ambedkar is a respected leader and his organisation is with us. We have made several requests to him. He should have accepted our proposal and we are still hopeful that he will accept our proposal,” Raut said.\"\"\""
